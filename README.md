# PaperFidelityExamples-
The nb file extension is associated with Mathematica and used for its notebooks.

# Functions.nb
In this .nb file, we provided all function prototypes involved in the paper.
For example:
1. QMCinitialize : to construct QMC model when given the corresponding information of quantum Markov chain such as the classical states, Kraus representation of transition operators, etc.
2. ComputeBSCC : to compute the direct sum of BSCC, return a basis of BSCC subspace.
3. NextSOVM, BuntilSOVM, UBuntilSOVM : compute the matrix representation of SOVMs corresponding to atomic next/bounded-time until/unbounded-time until path formulae respectively.
4. DecideFidQuantifierFormu : decide the fidelity-quantifier formulae with threshold.
5. Other intermediate called functions.

# Example-BasicInfo.nb
In this .nb file, we provide the running exmaple in the paper.

# NOTE 
Before calling the functions in Functions.nb, you should execute the file in advance (press Shift+Enter to execute the code in each wolfram text box).
